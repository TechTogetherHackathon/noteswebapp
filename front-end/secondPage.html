            We made made a microservice out of a pre-trained BERT model to
            summarize text, and an Express web server that works with Vue for
            the UI to make a web app. The web app accepts video uploads, sends
            the video to Azure's Speech-to-Text API to get a full transcript,
            sends the transcript to the microservice to get a summary with
            timestamps, and sends the summary and timestamps to Vue for display
            and video playback. Challenges we ran into Managing cloud platform
            credentials in a team of 4 was difficult. Coordinating ourselves to
            avoid duplicating work. Managing packages and dependencies. Scope
            creep. Timestamps need to formatted to "minutes : seconds".
            Accomplishments that we're proud of Most technically sophisticated
            hackathon project so far, as the project has many moving parts like
            Azure Media Services (for video playback), Azure Cognitive Services
            (for the Speech-to-Text API), and BERT (for text summarization). Fun
            name ;) What we learned CORS, JavaScript Promises, Microservice
